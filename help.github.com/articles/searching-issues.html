However, you can use the <strong>type</strong> qualifier to restrict search results to issues or pull requests only.</p> <dl> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=cat+type%3Apr&type=Issues">cat type:pr</a></dt> <dd>Matches pull requests with the word cat.</dd> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=github+commenter%3Adefunkt+type%3Aissue&type=Issues">github commenter:defunkt type:issue</a></dt> <dd>Matches issues that contain the word github, and have a comment by @defunkt.</dd> </dl> <h3> <a name="scope-the-search-fields" class="anchor" href="#scope-the-search-fields"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Scope the search fields</h3> <p>The <strong>in</strong> qualifier limits what fields are searched. With this qualifier you can restrict the search to just the title, body, comments, or any combination of these. Without the qualifier, only the title and body are searched.</p> <dl> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=warning+in%3Atitle&type=Issues">warning in:title</a></dt> <dd>Matches issues with warning in their title.</dd> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=error+in%3Atitle%2Cbody&type=Issues">error in:title,body</a></dt> <dd>Matches issues with error in their title or body.</dd> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=shipit+in%3Acomment&type=Issues">shipit in:comment</a></dt> <dd>Matches issues mentioning :shipit: in their comments.</dd> </dl> <h3> <a name="search-inside-public-and-private-repositories" class="anchor" href="#search-inside-public-and-private-repositories"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Search inside public and private repositories</h3> <p>If you're <a href="https://github.com/search">searching across all of GitHub</a>, it can be helpful to filter your results based on whether the repository is public or private. You can do this with <code>is:private</code> and <code>is:public</code>.</p> <dl> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apublic&type=Issues">is:public</a></dt> <dd>Lists all the issues and pull requests in all public repositories.</dd> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=is%3Aprivate&type=Issues">is:private cupcake</a></dt> <dd>Searches for issues and pull requests that talk about cupcakes in all the private repositories that you have access to.</dd> </dl> <h3> <a name="search-by-the-author-of-an-issue-or-pull-request" class="anchor" href="#search-by-the-author-of-an-issue-or-pull-request"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Search by the author of an issue or pull request</h3> <p>The <strong>author</strong> qualifier finds issues created by a certain user. For example:</p> <dl> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=cool+author%3Agjtorikian&type=Issues">cool author:gjtorikian</a></dt> <dd>Matches issues with the word cool, created by @gjtorikian.</dd> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=bootstrap+in%3Abody+author%3Amdo&type=Issues">bootstrap in:body author:mdo</a></dt> <dd>Matches issues written by @mdo that contain the word bootstrap in the body.</dd> </dl> <h3> <a name="search-by-the-assignee-of-an-issue-or-pull-request" class="anchor" href="#search-by-the-assignee-of-an-issue-or-pull-request"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Search by the assignee of an issue or pull request</h3> <p>Much like with author, the <strong>assignee</strong> qualifier finds issues that are <em>assigned</em> to a certain user. For example:</p> <dl> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=assignee%3Avmg&type=Issues">assignee:vmg</a></dt> <dd>Matches issues assigned to @vmg.</dd> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=assignee%3Afjakobs+repo%3Aajaxorg%2Face&type=Issues">assignee:fjakobs repo:ajaxorg/ace</a></dt> <dd>Matches issues assigned to @fjakobs within the @ajaxorg/ace repository.</dd> </dl> <h3> <a name="search-by-a-mentioned-user-within-an-issue-or-pull-request" class="anchor" href="#search-by-a-mentioned-user-within-an-issue-or-pull-request"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Search by a mentioned user within an issue or pull request</h3> <p>The <strong>mentions</strong> qualifier finds issues that mention a certain user. For example:</p> <dl> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=resque+mentions%3Adefunkt&type=Issues">resque mentions:defunkt</a></dt> <dd>Matches issues with the word "resque" that mention @defunkt anywhere.</dd> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=mentions%3Aazakus+assignee%3Aarv&type=Issues">mentions:azakus assignee:arv</a></dt> <dd>Matches issues that mention @azakus but are assigned to @arv.</dd> </dl> <h3> <a name="search-by-a-commenter-within-an-issue-or-pull-request" class="anchor" href="#search-by-a-commenter-within-an-issue-or-pull-request"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Search by a commenter within an issue or pull request</h3> <p>The <strong>commenter</strong> qualifier finds issues that contain a comment from a certain user. For example:</p> <dl> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=commenter%3Alennartcl&type=Issues">commenter:lennartcl</a></dt> <dd>Matches issues @lennartcl commented on.</dd> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=github+commenter%3Adefunkt+user%3Agithub&type=Issues">github commenter:defunkt user:github</a></dt> <dd>Matches issues in repositories owned by GitHub, that contain the word github, and have a comment by @defunkt.</dd> </dl> <h3> <a name="search-by-a-user-thats-involved-within-an-issue-or-pull-request" class="anchor" href="#search-by-a-user-thats-involved-within-an-issue-or-pull-request"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Search by a user that's involved within an issue or pull request</h3> <p>You can use the <strong>involves</strong> qualifier for finding issues that in some way involve a certain user. The <strong>involves</strong> qualifier is just a logical OR between the <strong>author</strong>, <strong>assignee</strong>, <strong>mentions</strong> and <strong>commenter</strong> qualifiers for the same user. In other words, this qualifier finds issues that were either created by a certain user, assigned to that user, mention that user, or were commented on by that user.</p> <dl> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=involves%3Adefunkt+involves%3Ajlord&type=Issues">involves:defunkt involves:jlord</a></dt> <dd>Matches issues either @defunkt or @jlord are involved in.</dd> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=NOT+bootstrap+in%3Abody+involves%3Amdo&type=Issues">NOT bootstrap in:body involves:mdo</a></dt> <dd>Matches issues @mdo is involved in that do not contain the word bootstrap in the body.</dd> </dl> <h3> <a name="search-by-a-team-thats-mentioned-within-an-issue-or-pull-request" class="anchor" href="#search-by-a-team-thats-mentioned-within-an-issue-or-pull-request"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Search by a team that's mentioned within an issue or pull request</h3> <p>For organizations you're a member of, you can use the <strong>team</strong> qualifier to find issues or pull requests that @mention a certain team within that organization.</p> <dl> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=team%3Ajekyll%2Fowners&type=Issues">team:jekyll/owners</a></dt> <dd>Matches issues where the `@jekyll/owners` team is mentioned.</dd> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=team%3Ajekyll%2Fowners&type=Issues">team:myorg/ops is:open is:pr</a></dt> <dd>Matches open pull requests where the `@myorg/ops` team is mentioned.</dd> </dl> <h3> <a name="search-based-on-whether-an-issue-or-pull-request-is-open" class="anchor" href="#search-based-on-whether-an-issue-or-pull-request-is-open"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Search based on whether an issue or pull request is open</h3> <p>You can choose to filter issues based on whether they're open or closed based on the <strong>state</strong> qualifier. For example:</p> <dl> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=terrible+state%3Aclosed+in%3Abody&type=Issues">terrible state:closed in:body</a></dt> <dd>Matches closed issues with the word terrible in the body (how rude).</dd> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=ie+state%3Aopen+mentions%3Afat&type=Issues">ie state:open mentions:fat</a></dt> <dd>Matches open issues that mention @fat with the word ie.</dd> </dl> <h3> <a name="search-by-the-labels-on-an-issue" class="anchor" href="#search-by-the-labels-on-an-issue"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Search by the labels on an issue</h3> <p>You can narrow your results by labels, using the <strong>label</strong> qualifier. Since issues can have multiple labels, you can list a separate qualifier for each issue. For example:</p> <dl> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=cat+label%3Abug&type=Issues">cat label:bug</a></dt> <dd>Matches issues with the word cat that are also labelled with bug.</dd> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?l=&q=label%3Abug+label%3Aresolved&ref=advsearch&type=Issues">label:bug label:resolved</a></dt> <dd>Matches issues with the labels bug and resolved.</dd> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=broken+in%3Abody+-label%3Abug+label%3Apriority&type=Issues">broken in:body -label:bug label:priority</a></dt> <dd>Matches issues with the word "broken" in the body, that lack the label "bug", but *do* have the label "priority".</dd> </dl> <h3> <a name="search-by-missing-metadata-on-an-issue-or-pull-request" class="anchor" href="#search-by-missing-metadata-on-an-issue-or-pull-request"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Search by missing metadata on an issue or pull request</h3> <p>You can scope issues and pull requests to those missing certain metadata using the <strong>no</strong> qualifier. That metadata includes:</p> <ul> <li>Labels</li> <li>Milestones</li> <li>Assignees</li> </ul> <dl> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=priority+no%3Alabel&type=Issues">priority no:label</a></dt> <dd>Matches issues and pull requests with the word "priority" that also don't have any labels.</dd> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=sprint+no%3Amilestone+type%3Aissue&type=Issues">sprint no:milestone type:issue</a></dt> <dd>Matches issues not associated with a milestone containing the word sprint.</dd> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=important+no%3Aassignee+language%3Ajava+type%3Aissue&type=Issues">important no:assignee language:java type:issue</a></dt> <dd>Matches issues not associated with an assignee, containing the word "important," and in Java repositories.</dd> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=important+no%3Aassignee+language%3Ajava+type%3Aissue&type=Issues">important no:assignee language:java type:issue</a></dt> <dd>Matches issues not associated with an assignee, containing the word "important," and in Java repositories.</dd> </dl> <h3> <a name="search-by-the-main-language-of-a-repository" class="anchor" href="#search-by-the-main-language-of-a-repository"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Search by the main language of a repository</h3> <p>You can choose to search for issues within repositories that match a certain language with the <strong>language</strong> qualifiers. For example:</p> <dl> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=language%3Aruby+state%3Aopen&type=Issues">language:ruby state:open</a></dt> <dd>Matches open issues that are in Ruby repositories.</dd> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=mentions%3Aholman+language%3Abash&type=Issues">mentions:holman language:bash</a></dt> <dd>Matches issues that mention @holman within repositories containing Bash code.</dd> </dl> <h3> <a name="search-based-on-the-state-of-an-issue-or-pull-request" class="anchor" href="#search-based-on-the-state-of-an-issue-or-pull-request"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Search based on the state of an issue or pull request</h3> <p>The <strong>is</strong> qualifier is unique, in that it provides a more human syntax to accomplish several of the above queries. For example, you can use the <strong>is</strong> qualifier to determine if:</p> <ul> <li>An item is <code>open</code> or <code>closed</code>.</li> <li>An item is <code>merged</code> or <code>unmerged</code>.</li> <li>An item is a <code>pr</code> or an <code>issue</code>.</li> </ul> <p>Here are some sample queries demonstrating these properties:</p> <dl> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=bugfix+is%3Apr+is%3Aunmerged&type=Issues">bugfix is:pr is:unmerged</a></dt> <dd>Matches pull requests that are unmerged with the word bugfix in them.</dd> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=performance+is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue&type=Issues">performance is:open is:issue</a></dt> <dd>Matches open issues with the word performance in them.</dd> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=error+is%3Aclosed&type=Issues">error is:closed</a></dt> <dd>Matches closed issues and pull requests with the word error in them.</dd> </dl> <h3> <a name="search-based-on-when-an-issue-or-pull-request-was-created-or-last-updated" class="anchor" href="#search-based-on-when-an-issue-or-pull-request-was-created-or-last-updated"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Search based on when an issue or pull request was created or last updated</h3> <p>You can filter issues based on times of creation, or when they were last updated. For issue creation, you can use the <strong>created</strong> qualifier; to find out when an issue was last updated, you'll want to use the <strong>updated</strong> qualifier.</p> <p>Both take a date as a parameter, which must be in the format of <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>--that's year, followed by month, followed by day. You can continue to use <code>&lt;</code> to refer to "before a date" and <code>&gt;</code> for after a date. For example:</p> <dl> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=language%3Ac%23+created%3A%3C2011-01-01+state%3Aopen&type=Issues">language:c# created:&lt;2011-01-01 state:open</a></dt> <dd>Matches open issues that were created before 2011 in repositories written in C#.</dd> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=weird+in%3Abody+updated%3A%3E%3D2013-02-01&type=Issues">weird in:body updated:&gt;=2013-02-01</a></dt> <dd>Matches issues with the word weird in the body that were updated after February 2013.</dd> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=author%3Apuzrin+created%3A2012-11-01..2012-12-01&type=Issues">author:puzrin created:2012-11-01..2012-12-01</a></dt> <dd>Matches issues created by @puzrin created between November and December of 2012.</dd> </dl> <h3> <a name="search-based-on-when-a-pull-request-was-merged" class="anchor" href="#search-based-on-when-a-pull-request-was-merged"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Search based on when a pull request was merged</h3> <p>You can filter pull requests based on when they were merged, using the <strong>merged</strong> qualifier.</p> <p>This qualifier takes a date as its parameter, which must be in the format of <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>--that's year, followed by month, followed by day. You can continue to use <code>&lt;</code> to refer to "before a date," and <code>&gt;</code> as after a date. For example:</p> <dl> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=language%3Ajavascript+merged%3A%3C2011-01-01+&type=Issues">language:javascript merged:&lt;2011-01-01 </a></dt> <dd>Matches pull requests in JavaScript repositories that were merged before 2011.</dd> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=fast+in%3Atitle+language%3Aruby+merged%3A%3E%3D2014-05-01+&type=Issues">fast in:title language:ruby merged:&gt;=2014-05-01</a></dt> <dd>Matches pull requests in Ruby with the word "fast" in the title that were merged after May 2014.</dd> </dl> <h3> <a name="search-based-on-when-an-issue-or-pull-request-was-closed" class="anchor" href="#search-based-on-when-an-issue-or-pull-request-was-closed"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Search based on when an issue or pull request was closed</h3> <p>You can filter issues and pull requests based on when they were closed, using the <strong>closed</strong> qualifier.</p> <p>This qualifier takes a date as its parameter, which must be in the format of <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>--that's year, followed by month, followed by day. You can continue to use <code>&lt;</code> to refer to "before a date," and <code>&gt;</code> as after a date. For example:</p> <dl> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=silly+in%3Abody+closed%3A%3C2012-10-01+&type=Issues">silly in:body closed:&lt;2012-10-01</a></dt> <dd>Matches issues and pull requests with the word "silly" in the body that were closed before October 2012.</dd> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=language%3Aswift+closed%3A%3E2014-06-11&type=Issues">language:swift closed:&gt;2014-06-11</a></dt> <dd>Matches issues and pull requests in Swift that were closed after June 11, 2014.</dd> </dl> <h3> <a name="search-by-the-number-of-comments-an-issue-or-pull-request-has" class="anchor" href="#search-by-the-number-of-comments-an-issue-or-pull-request-has"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Search by the number of comments an issue or pull request has</h3> <p>You can choose to qualify matched labels based on comments by adding a <strong>comments</strong> range. For example:</p> <dl> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=state%3Aclosed+comments%3A%3C100&type=Issues">state:closed comments:&gt;100</a></dt> <dd>Matches closed issues with more than 100 comments.</dd> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=comments%3A500..1000&type=Issues">comments:500..1000</a></dt> <dd>Matches issues with comments ranging from 500 to 1,000.</dd> </dl> <h3> <a name="search-within-a-users-or-organizations-repositories" class="anchor" href="#search-within-a-users-or-organizations-repositories"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Search within a user's or organization's repositories</h3> <p>To grab a list of issues from all repositories owned by a certain user or organization, you can use the <strong>user</strong> syntax. For getting a list of issues from a specific repository, you can use the <strong>repo</strong> syntax. For example:</p> <dl> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=user%3Adefunkt+ubuntu&type=Issues">user:defunkt ubuntu</a></dt> <dd>Matches issues with the word ubuntu from repositories owned by @defunkt.</dd> <dt><a href="https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Amozilla%2Fshumway+created%3A%3C2012-03-01&type=Issues">repo:mozilla/shumway created:&lt;2012-03-01</a></dt> <dd>Matches issues from @mozilla's shumway project that were created before March 2012.</dd> </dl> <h3> <a name="search-by-the-commit-shas-within-a-pull-request" class="anchor" href="#search-by-the-commit-shas-within-a-pull-request"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Search by the commit SHAs within a pull request</h3> <p>If you know the specific SHA hash of a commit, you can use it to search for pull requests that contain that SHA.
