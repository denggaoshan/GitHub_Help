In other words, if you're upgrading, you get instant access to more private repositories. If you're downgrading to a smaller (or free), the private repositories you have are instantly <a href="unlocking-a-locked-account.html">locked</a>.</p> <h2> <a name="what-happens-to-my-billing-when-i-change-my-plan" class="anchor" href="#what-happens-to-my-billing-when-i-change-my-plan"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What happens to my billing when I change my plan?</h2> <p>The effect on how much you're billed depends on whether you're on a <em>monthly</em> or <em>yearly</em> billing cycle.</p> <h3> <a name="monthly-billing" class="anchor" href="#monthly-billing"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Monthly billing</h3> <p>Monthly users are billed at the new plan rate on their next monthly billing date. Since we don't count partial months of the new plan, you may get some complimentary days of upgraded access while only having to pay the lower price.</p> <blockquote> <p>Example: Eric is a monthly user and pays for the Small Plan on the 15th of every month. If, on July 31st, Eric upgrades from the Small to the Medium Plan, he get the benefits of the Medium Plan immediately, but only starts paying for the new Medium Plan rate on August 15th.</p> </blockquote> <p>For downgrades, the converse is true:</p> <blockquote> <p>Example: Rebecca is a monthly user and pays for the Small Plan on the 15th of every month. If, on July 31st, Rebecca downgrades from the Small to the Micro Plan, her account immediately switches to the Micro Plan, but Rebecca won't be refunded for the period from August 1st to 15th for which she has already paid the cost of the Small Plan.</p> </blockquote> <p>This policy applies even if you are downgrading to a free account:</p> <blockquote> <p>Example: Joe is a monthly user and pays for the Micro Plan on the 5th of every month. If, on October 10th, Joe downgrades from the Small to the Free Plan, his account immediately switches to the Free Plan, access to his private repositories are locked, and Joe won't be refunded for the remaining unused portion of the month.</p> </blockquote> <h3> <a name="yearly-billing" class="anchor" href="#yearly-billing"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Yearly billing</h3> <p>Yearly users are only billed for the difference in price between their old and new rates based on the number of unused whole months. Again, since we don't count partial months of the new plan, you may get some complimentary days of upgraded access while having paid the lower price.</p> <blockquote> <p>Example: Mada is a yearly user and usually pays for the Small Plan on July 15th of every year. If, on July 31st, she upgrades from the Small to the Medium Plan, she immediately gets the benefits of the Medium Plan. She is also billed immediately for the difference between Small and Medium plans from the next remaining whole month to the end of her current yearly billing cycle. She pays the extra amount it costs for Medium from August 15th through July 15th of the following year, even though she had 11.5 months on the Medium Plan.</p> </blockquote> <p>For downgrades, yearly users are refunded the difference in price between their old and new rates based on the number of unused and partially used whole months. Again, you may get some complimentary days of upgraded access while having paid the lower price.</p> <blockquote> <p>Example: Mada is a yearly user and usually pays for the Small Plan on July 15th of every year. If, on July 31st, Mada decides to downgrade from the Small to the Micro Plan, her account immediately switches to the Micro Plan, and she is refunded the difference between Small and Micro plans for 12 months (until July 15th of the following year).</p> </blockquote> <p>This policy applies even if you are downgrading to a free account.</p> <blockquote> <p>Example: Joe is a yearly user and usually pays for the Micro Plan on October 5th every year. If, on October 10th, Joe downgrades from the Small to the Free Plan, his account immediately switches to the Free Plan, access to his private repositories will be locked, and Joe is refunded for the entire month of October, and the remaining unused months in his yearly billing cycle, which would be a total of 12 months.</p> </blockquote> </div> <div class="support-footer"> <hr /> <ul class="article-footer button-nav"> <li> <a href="https://github.com/contact" class="minibutton"> <span class="octicon octicon-comment-discussion"></span> Contact a human </a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class="clear"></div> </div> </div> </div> <div id="footer"> <div class="inner"> <a href="https://github.com/" class="invertocat"> <img alt="The GitHub Logo" src="../assets/images/site/invertocat.png" width="24" height="24" /> </a> <p class="left"> &copy; <span id="year">2014</span> GitHub Inc.
